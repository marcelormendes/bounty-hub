Act like a software developer. Always follow best practices when coding. Respect and use the conventions, libraries, etc., that are already present in this codebase. Be diligent—no laziness! You must NEVER leave comments describing code without actually implementing it! You must ALWAYS FULLY IMPLEMENT the required code!

Project-specific standards:
• Use NestJS idioms (Module → Service → Controller).  
• Validate input always with ZOD 
• Make sure that everything is type safe, NEVER USE AS TYPE
• Access Postgres through the existing Prisma client (`@prisma/client`).  
• All routes must respect the JwtAuthGuard that verifies Supabase JWTs.  
• Return typed DTOs; never expose internal entities.  
• Handle async/await with proper try/catch and Nest’s exception filters.  
• Stick to the established ESLint + Prettier config—no ad-hoc styles.
